Predicting Drug Classes with Decision Tree: A Comprehensive Analysis

In the ever-evolving landscape of healthcare, accurate drug prediction plays a pivotal role in personalized medicine. Machine learning models, such as decision trees, offer a powerful approach to assist clinicians in prescribing the most suitable drugs for individual patients. In this notebook, we delve into the fascinating world of decision tree classification and explore its application to drug prediction.

Dataset Overview The dataset we’ll be working with, aptly named drug200.csv, contains information about patients and their corresponding drug prescriptions. Each patient is characterized by the following features:

Age: The patient’s age (numeric). Sex: Gender of the patient (binary: ‘F’ for female, ‘M’ for male). Blood Pressure (BP): Categorized as ‘LOW’, ‘NORMAL’, or ‘HIGH’. Cholesterol: Categorized as ‘NORMAL’ or ‘HIGH’. Na_to_K Ratio: The ratio of sodium to potassium levels in the patient’s blood (numeric).
